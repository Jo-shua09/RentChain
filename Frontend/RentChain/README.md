## Available Scripts

- `dev` — Start the development server with HMR.
- `build` — Create an optimized production build.
- `preview` — Preview the production build locally.
- `lint` — Run ESLint to check for code issues.

## Plugins Used

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) — Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh and JSX transformation.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) — Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for even faster Fast Refresh and compilation.

## Recommended Setup

For production-grade applications, consider the following enhancements:

- **TypeScript:** Add static typing for improved reliability and maintainability. See the [React + TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).
- **Type-Aware Linting:** Use [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) for advanced linting rules.
- **Testing:** Integrate testing frameworks like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
- **State Management:** Consider libraries like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for complex state needs.
- **Styling:** Use CSS-in-JS solutions or frameworks like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for scalable styling.
